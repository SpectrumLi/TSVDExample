# What is TSVD
TSVD is a thread-safety violation detecting tool designed in the paper "Efficient and Scalable Thread-Safety Violation Detection --- Finding thousands of concurrency bugs during testing" in SOSP2019.

## What is thread-safety violation
Some research results discover that it is fairly common that developers erroneously assume some concurrent accesses on different part of a data struture is thread safe. For example :

even key1 is different with key2, it is still possible to lead a undetermined result.

### What kind of class is not thread-safe
In C#, most classes in System.Collections are thread-unsafe unless they are protected by a specific lock.

## How to apply TSVD

### Overview
There are only three easy steps to adopt TSVD for your software.

+ Compile the TSVD source code. It generates a `TSVDInstrumenter.exe` in `src/TSVDInstrumenter/bin/Debug`.
+ Instrucment the testing binary with `TSVDInstrumenter.exe`. The usage of `TSVDInstrumenter.exe` is:


    .\TSVDInstrumenter.exe [directory to the testing binary] [path to instrument configuration] [path to runtime configuration]


+ Run the test as normal.

### Example

TestApps/DataRace is an example to demonstrate how to apply TSVD:
+ Preparion. Compile the DataRace source code. It generates a DataRace.exe in `DataRace/bin/Debug`. 
+ Instrumentation. Under DataRace/bin/Debug, run the following command in command line:


    & ..\..\..\..\src\TSVDInstrumenter\bin\Debug\TSVDInstrumenter.exe . .\Configurations\instrumentation-config.cfg .\Configurations\runtime-config.cfg


+ Run. After observing the `Instrumentation result: OK`, run `.\DataRace.exe`. TSVD-bug file contains the detected thread-safety violation information.
