# What is TSVD

TSVD is a thread-safety violation detecting tool designed in the paper "Efficient and Scalable Thread-Safety Violation Detection --- Finding thousands of concurrency bugs during testing" in SOSP2019.

## What is thread-safety violation

Some research results discover that it is fairly common that developers erroneously assume some concurrent accesses on different part of a data structure is thread safe. For example :

    //Dictionary dict
    Thread1: dict.Add(key1,value);
    Thread2: dict.ContainsKey(key2);
    
Even key1 is different with key2, it is still possible to lead a undetermined result.

### What kind of class is not thread-safe

In C#, most classes in System.Collections are thread-unsafe unless they are protected by a specific lock.

## How to apply TSVD

### Overview

There are only three easy steps to adopt TSVD for your software.

+ Compile the TSVD source code. It generates a `TSVDInstrumenter.exe` in `src/TSVDInstrumenter/bin/Debug`.
+ Instrucment the testing binaries with `TSVDInstrumenter.exe`. The usage of `TSVDInstrumenter.exe` is:

    `.\TSVDInstrumenter.exe [directory to the testing binary] [path to instrument configuration] [path to runtime configuration]`

+ Run the test as normal.

### Example

TestApps/DataRace is an example to demonstrate how to apply TSVD:

+ Preparion. Compile the DataRace source code. It generates a DataRace.exe in `DataRace/bin/Debug`. 
+ Instrumentation. Under DataRace/bin/Debug, run the following command in command line:

    `& ..\..\..\..\src\TSVDInstrumenter\bin\Debug\TSVDInstrumenter.exe . .\Configurations\instrumentation-config.cfg .\Configurations\runtime-config.cfg`. It insturcments all the binaries in the current folder. Since there is only one exe/dll in the current folder, it will only instrument `DataRace.exe`.

+ Run. After observing the `Instrumentation result: OK`, run `.\DataRace.exe` (the current `DataRace.exe` is already instrumented). Since the insturmented `DataRace.exe`, it writes all the detected thread-safety violation to the `TSVD-bug-*.tsvdlog` file.
